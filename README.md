- [React-hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

### Getting Started:

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

```
Node -> NPM
```

### Installing

Once you got your copy of the project

```
npm install
```

Then run:

```
npm start
```

Enjoy :)

### Notes:

- Although a small project, I used MobX to ease working with the app's state (limit the prop-drilling), also having in mind future development, which could prove difficult when the app grows.

### Known issues:

- Need to work on mocking the api calls
